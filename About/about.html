      <h2 class="about_headings">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hello there! My name is Pranaw Bajracharya. I study computer science at
        Portland State University. I worked at Apple as a sales specialist and I
        have experience working as a game design instructor for ID Tech. I
        believe my time in sales and instruction has given me the ability to
        communicate effectively in most situations. My personal projects mostly
        deal with robotics and video game design, and can be seen on my Github.
        Iâ€™ve mainly worked with Java, C++, and Python. I aspire to know how
        everything works. As long as the work gives me insight into how a system
        or concept works, I am content.
      </p>
      <h2 class="about_headings">Future Goals</h2>
      <p>
        I will be participating in two 6 month internships through the MECOP
        program, and anticipate graduating with my B.S. in Computer Science Fall
        of 2023. Afterwards, I hope to work in Robotics, Automation, or OS
        development. I am also interested in working in Game Engine development
        and perhaps working with data and simulation. After working in the
        industry for a long while, I hope to return to school to attain a PhD in
        Electrical Engineering and Computer science to satisfy my curiosity.
      </p>

              My biggest hobby would have to be watching cartoons. I'm always
              amazed by the amount of animation I watch. There's a good chance
              that I have seen pretty much every animated show that you can name
              as long as it's from after the 90s. Among my favorite shows of all
              time are Spectacular Spider-Man, Dr. Stone, and 2003's Teenage
              Mutant Ninja Turtles.

            My second biggest hobby is gaming. I don't really have a genre of
            games that are my favorite. I usually find a few games I really like
            and spend tons of time on them. Some games that I love playing right
            now are Civilization 6, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and Skyrim.

            I am essentially a father of 3 cats. I have an orange tabby cat
            named Nebula who I adopted in the summer of 2020. She's incredibly
            loud and annoying but I suppose that's a part of her charm. She's
            very cuddly however, it also means she never leaves me alone. My
            girlfriend has two cats named Inky and Penny that I take care of
            often. Inky is a black cat and essentially the "perfect" cat. She is
            a slient predator that will manage to scare you in the night even
            though you know she's there. She's very well behaved and cuddly on
            occassion. Lastly, Penny is a fearful and gluttonous cat, but the
            most sweet and cuddly of all. Penny is very kind and cute.
