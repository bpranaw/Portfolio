        All of my projects can be access on my
        <a href="https://www.github.com/bpranaw"> Github</a>. You will see
        mostly code for controlling Robots. I also have solutions to
        mathematical questions, games, and school projects. I've written
        summaries of a few of my projects below.

      <h1 class="experience_heading">FTC Robot Control</h1>
      <p>
        This project can be found
        <a
          href="https://github.com/bpranaw/ftc_app/tree/750/TeamCode/src/main/java"
        >
          here</a
        >. The project was based on the FTC mobile app which allowed us to use
        Wi-Fi direct to wirelessly control hardware connected through the Rev
        Robotics Control Hub. The project had two main purpose: allow us to
        control the Robot Autonomously, and allow us to control the robot with a
        controller.
      </p>
      <p>
        The competition provided the initial code that would allow the software
        to communicate with the hardware, it was my job to properly create that
        interface for the specific hardware components of our robot. I
        interfaced the robot's motors, servos, and sensors with the software.
        Depending on the configuration of the driving mechanism, I would have to
        base the robot's motor movements on special equations. For instance, our
        Robot design from 2017-2018 allowed it to move in all two dimensional
        directions, with or without rotating. That meant the power going to each
        motor had to be adjusted just right to achieve that precise movement.
      </p>

      <p>
        The part of the coe I was particularly proud of at the time was the
        abstraction I managed to achieve with the autonomous movement of the
        robot. I abstraced the code to the point where I could essentially just
        tell the robot "move forward, land, go xyz distance when you see yellow"
        in a simple way. This project was solely written in Java, and incrased
        my knowledge of Java and Object Oriented Programming.

      <h1 class="experience_heading">Euler Problems</h1>
      <p>
        This project can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/bpranaw/Euler-Problems"> here</a>. It holds
        my solutions to problems from the
        <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> website. Project
        Euler contains math problems that require both mathematical and computer
        science knowledge to solve efficiently. Essentially, most of the
        problems are too ridiciously tediuous for human calculation but perfect
        for a machine. Some problems I've computed include: finding the largest
        prime factor of x number, sum of all fibonacci numbers to the nth
        number, largest palindrome of the product of two three digit numbers. I
        decided to do this project in Python so I could learn the language and
        focus on completing the math instead of the code.

    <div class="about general_template">
      <a id="project3"></a>
      <h1 class="experience_heading">Tek-Bot Assignment</h1>
      <p>
        This project can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/bpranaw/Tekbot-Control"> here</a>. It's a
        simple project where I interfaced the components of an Arduino Nano
        based robot with software, and wrote a script that allowed it to
        traverse a maze. The robot would use an ultrasonic sensor to essentially
        "see" what was in front of it, and then make the decision to go forward.
        Then if not, it would go right, and if that was not possible, it would
        go left. If none were possible, it would turn around and start again.
        The difficult part of this project was mostly figuring out how the
        Arduino's hardware could be connected to software. The project was
        written in c++ in the Arduino IDE.
