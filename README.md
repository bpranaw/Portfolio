# Portfolio Project for CS 410 - Intro to Web Design

This project is a portfolio that contains informatin about myself and a few of my projects. 
It is intended to be and currently is deployed on Github Pages at the url: https://bpranaw.github.io/Portfolio/index.html .
Due to the way Github Pages reads the repository, the links in the navbar are absolute but from a scope that are beyond
where they would be in code. For this reason, if you were to download the repository and try to launch some of the navbar
links on a local live server, it would not be able to get those locations. I tried to minimize this with relative links but 
the issue still exists. I call it an "issue" but it works as intended on the intended deployment site.

The website is written in standard HTML5 with CSS, and base Javascript. Bootstrap was used for its grid system and colors.
I do not own many of the images on the site. The only images that are mine are the ones of myself and my cats. The game that
is on the site was based on the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG2BmmYr9NQ . 

The individual html pages can be run on most browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. There isn't anything here that 
needs to run outside of a browser.
